<p class="presentation">Think of a specific time you were located 10 years ago. Now, go back to the place you were sitting last night, and at the same time think about were you would like to be tomorrow. In our mind we have just traveled thru time and space at the speed of thought. But since we are made of matter, and thus bound to space and time this idea dwells only in our imagination. 
	Let us dive into the vast universe and explore dark matter, redshift, the special theory of relativity and the particle of light, the photon. Let's travel at the speed of thought, not bound to space and time, nor composed of matter.
