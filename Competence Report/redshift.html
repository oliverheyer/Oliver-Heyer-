    <h1>Redshift</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Redshift, displacement of the spectrum of an astronomical object toward longer (red) wavelengths. It is generally attributed to the Doppler effect, a change in wavelength that results when a given source of waves (e.g., light or radio waves) and an observer are in rapid motion with respect to each other.

        The American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble reported in 1929 that the distant galaxies were receding from the Milky Way system, in which Earth is located, and that their redshifts increase proportionally with their increasing distance. This generalization became the basis for what is called Hubble’s law, which correlates the recessional velocity of a galaxy with its distance from Earth. That is to say, the greater the redshift manifested by light emanating from such an object, the greater the distance of the object and the larger its recessional velocity (see also Hubble’s constant). This law of redshifts has been confirmed by subsequent research and provides the cornerstone of modern relativistic cosmological theories that postulate that the universe is expanding.
        Expanding universe, dynamic state of the extragalactic realm, the discovery of which transformed 20th-century cosmology. The development of general relativity and its application to cosmology by German-born physicist Albert Einstein, Dutch mathematician Willem de Sitter, and other theoreticians, along with the detection of extragalactic redshift (a shift to the longer wavelengths of light from galaxies beyond the Milky Way) by American astronomer Vesto Slipher, led to the realization in the 1920s that all galaxies are receding. American astronomer Edwin Hubble correlated these observations in mathematical form to provide evidence that the universe is expanding. The discovery of the 2.7 K cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 by American physicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was convincing evidence that the universe originated 13.8 billion years ago from a very dense and hot state in the big bang.
        For much of the 20th century, it was an open question whether the universe is open (of infinite extent in space) or closed (of finite extent) and whether the universe in the future will continue to expand indefinitely or will eventually collapse back into an extremely dense congested state. The mass in galaxies observed directly, when averaged over cosmological distances, is estimated to be only a few percent of the amount required to close the universe. However, the dark matter that has been deduced from various dynamic arguments is about 23 percent of the universe, and dark energy supplies the remaining amount, bringing the total average mass density up to 100 percent of the closure density.
        Hubble’s constant, in cosmology, constant of proportionality in the relation between the velocities of remote galaxies and their distances. It expresses the rate at which the universe is expanding. It is denoted by the symbol H0, where the subscript denotes that the value is measured at the present time, and named in honour of Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who attempted in 1929 to measure its value. With redshifts of distant galaxies measured by Vesto Slipher, also of the United States, and with his own distance estimates of these galaxies, Hubble established the cosmological velocity-distance law:
        velocity = H0 × distance.
        According to this law, known as the Hubble law, the greater the distance of a galaxy, the faster it recedes. Derived from theoretical considerations and confirmed by observations, the velocity-distance law has made secure the concept of an expanding universe. Hubble’s original value for H0 was 150 km (93 miles) per second per 1,000,000 light-years. Modern estimates, using measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang, place the value of H0 at between 21.5 and 23.4 km (13.3 and 14.5 miles) per second per 1,000,000 light-years. The reciprocal of Hubble’s constant lies between 13 billion and 14 billion years, and this cosmic time scale serves as an approximate measure of the age of the universe.</p>
